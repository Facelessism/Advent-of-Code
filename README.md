### Advent-of-Code

This repository contains my solutions for **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** 
It is an annual programming puzzle event held every December. 
Each day unlocks a two-part challenge, and the goal is to solve the puzzles while writing readable, efficient, and fun code.

# Features
- Each day has its own folder.
- Each puzzle part is separated for clarity unless solved in a single script.
- No input datas or the questions have been revealed or stored in any folders/subfolders.
